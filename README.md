# Fraud-Detection
üìÇ Fraud Detection using Decision Trees

This project aims to detect fraud using a Decision Tree classifier. The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages various Python libraries including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and xgboost.

üîç Dataset

The financial transaction dataset, named `fraud dataset.csv`, is used for fraud detection. It contains information about different types of transactions, including fraudulent ones. The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further processing.

üìù Code Overview

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing:
   - Renaming columns to improve readability
   - Handling missing values
   - Converting data types to appropriate formats
   - Creating additional categorical features based on existing data
   
2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Statistical summary of the dataset
   - Identifying missing values
   - Checking data formats
   
3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization:
   - Count plots showing the number of transactions per type, highlighting fraud cases
   - Histogram plots displaying the distribution of transaction amounts, with fraud cases marked
   
4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering:
   - Dropping unnecessary columns
   - Applying logarithmic transformation to selected columns
   
5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training and Evaluation:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Training a Decision Tree classifier using the training set
   - Evaluating the model's accuracy score on the testing set
   - Visualizing the ROC AUC score, confusion matrix, and F1-score of the model
   
6Ô∏è‚É£ Predictions and Feature Importances:
   - Creating predictions using the trained model on a sample dataset
   - Visualizing the feature importances using the Decision Tree model

üîß Dependencies

To run the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

üí° How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost`.

2. Download the Jupyter Notebook (`fraud_detection.ipynb`) and the financial transaction dataset (`fraud dataset.csv`).

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code step-by-step.

5. Observe the EDA visualizations and the performance of the Decision Tree classifier.
